### Steps Of The Project
 We can summaries what We did in 5 steps


 1. take a look at the data itself and cheeked on the columns and rows to have a clear idea
 2. We did basic EDA and Cleaning
 3. Creating Deferent Modules
 4. Visualize the data
 5. Submitting the data in kaggle
 5. giting the score:0.79425
