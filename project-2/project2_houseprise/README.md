# Project 2 - Kaggle Challenges with House Prices (Regression)



## Problem Statement 

The data given is about `House Prices` and the mission is, to predict the prices 

In this project we want to have a better understanding for the housing features.

We have two datasets, which are train dataset and test dataset.

Data Sources:
[Train & Test](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

## Built With

Here are the tools I used to build this project and all of them come with anaconda
* [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [SeaBorn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

All you need is to make sure you download the complete file in this GitHub

that's include
* Code Folder
* Data Folder

## Steps Of The Project
 
 We can summaries what we did in 6 steps


 1. Load the datasets 
 2. Data cleansing
 3. cheeked for missing data, we looked at data types to see what is need to be fixed
 4. Visualize the data
 5. Machine learning
 6. Model learning and visualizations 

## Conclusion

our goal was to pridect the prices for House Prices dataset and we tryed to use diffrent models to see which model can preduce a better prediction, and we found that random forest model will give us a score of 0.162, which is the best score we got.
